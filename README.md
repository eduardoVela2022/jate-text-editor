# JATE Text Editor

## Description

The JATE text editor is a simple text editor where you can write your JavaScript code, but that’s not the only thing JATE is capable of, since it is also a Progressive Web Application (PWA). JATE can be downloaded and used as a computer application, and it can be even used offline. I built this project to learn what makes a PWA a PWA. They are useful since they give the user features that could be very helpful for them. For example, the ability to use the web app without an internet connection, could be pretty handy if the user’s internet when bust, or if the user feels like working in a place with no internet connection. All in all PWAs make web apps more powerful and versatile.
